The Python implementation to compute Generalized UniFrac distance

UniFrac is a method to calculate a distance measure between organismal communities using phylogenetic information, and is widely used in microbial ecology and metagenomic studies. 

GUniFrac (Generalized UniFrac distance)  unifies the weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance in a single framework.
This metric were proposed by:  Chen, J.; Bittinger, K.; Charlson, E. S.; Hoffmann, C.; Lewis, J.; Wu, G. D.; Collman, R. G.; Bushman, F. D.; Li, H. (2012). "Associating microbiome composition with environmental covariates using generalized UniFrac distances". Bioinformatics 28 (16): 2106â€“2113.
and all formulas are based on that paper.
